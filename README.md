## Skills going into this
As of **2022-03-07** I am currently working on the pyraminx in which I am able to solve. 
My current method is to focus on one side at a time solving each one individually until eventually all 4 sides have been solved.

| Average | Time (s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ao5 | 32.05 |
| ao12 | 35.12 |
| ao25 | 36.15 |


## Skills after day 2
As of **2022-03-08** I have been able to solve slightly faster then yesterday, but my times have been getting more consistent.
| Average | Time (s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ao5 | 31.23 |
| ao12 | 33.01 |
| ao25 | 33.89 |


## Skills after day 3
As of **2022-03-09** I have been able to solve faster then yesterday and get more consistent time. Furthermore, I got a fast solve. and sub 30 average.
| Average | Time (s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ao5 | 29.03 |
| ao12 | 29.78 |
| ao25 | 29.98 |

Solving the pyraminx has proved to be very beneficial and I believe that I have made substantial progress in decreasing my times.

## Starting the 2x2
As of **2022-03-10** I am currently unable to solve the 2x2 and so will begin watching youtube videos.
| Average | Time (s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ao5 | 5:25 |
| ao12 | 4:34 |

## Continuing the 2x2
As of **2022-03-15** I am no able to solve more consistently but not much faster.
| Average | Time (s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ao5 | 4:56 |
| ao12 | 5:10 |

Although I am by no means fast at solving the 2x2 my solves are getting more and more consistent and so while I am moving on to another cube I will continue to
work on the 2x2 on my own time.

## Starting the 3x3
As of **2022-03-17** I have located a 23x3 at my house and will begin solving it. I am currently able to solve 1 layer.
| Average | Time (s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ao5 | DNF |
| ao12 | DNF |

## Continuing the 3x3
As of **2022-03-19** I have made progress in solving this cube and am able to solve 2 layers.
| Average | Time (s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ao5 | DNF |
| ao12 | DNF |

Although I am currently unable to solve the 3x3 I am making substantial progress as I am getting more confident and more capable at solving more layers.

## Continuing the 3x3
As of **2022-03-21** I am now able to solve the cube although rather slow, and so due to how long my solves are I am adding a ao3
| Average | Time (s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ao3 | 20:34 |
| ao5 | DNF |
| ao12 | DNF |

## Working on the 3x3
As of **2022-03-28** I am able to solve it significantly faster than before.
| Average | Time (s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ao3 | 17:35 |
| ao5 | DNF |
| ao12 | DNF |

## Working on the 3x3
As of **2022-03-29** I am now able to achieve a ao5.
| Average | Time (s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ao3 | 10:22 |
| ao5 | 11:03 |
| ao12 | DNF |

## Working on the 3x3
As of **2022-03-29** I am now able to achieve a ao12.
| Average | Time (s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ao3 | 10:22 |
| ao5 | 11:03 |
| ao12 | 10:57 |

**Number 3**
Judged fellow classmate
| Average | Time (s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ao5 | 23.24 |
| ao12 | 22.98 |

## Resuming the pyraminx
As of **2022-03-31** I am now returning to the pyraminx. I have also found that going slowly actually ends up in faster times
| Average | Time (s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ao5 | 28.03 |
| ao12 | 28.78 |
| ao25 | 29.02 |
